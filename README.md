# A Novel Family of Edge Preserving Anisotropic Filters

In this study, new anisotropic image filters are introduced and their performances are compared with existing isotropic and anisotropic filters. The developed filters were examined according to their image noise removing performances in terms of standard image quality metrics, as well as the edge preserving properties of the filtered images. Mathematical inferences of anisotropic filters are made based on the minimization of the Polyakov action energy integral. New anisotropic metrics are found by means of Finsler metrics that minimize the corresponding integral. The new metrics perform filtering by updating the image with anisotropic Laplace-Beltrami flow. After filtering, it was observed that the introduced metrics perform well against other anisotropic metrics. It is also observed that the developed New Randers, New Normalized Miron, and New Metric filters preserve edges better than other filters, making it a plausible noise removal tool prior to edge detection in image processing.
